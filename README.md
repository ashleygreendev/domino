# Graphic Sphere Version 1

## Frameworks

Used THREE.js to simplify graphical use of WebGL. 

## Languages

In addition to the THREE.js framework, I used the following:
    - HTML
    - JavaScript (plain/vanilla JS)

## Updates for Version 2

There will be issues for the git repo 

## Branching Strategy

    - Create a branch for each version so the program can be reverted if need be
    - Merge branch version that is most up to date to master branch 

## Current Bugs
    - The number of spheres functionality adds objects on top of each other. This can be remedied by manipulating position of spheres in the array on the axis.
